# Calvin's theory of Darwin Machines

![](http://williamcalvin.com/img/bk9.jpg)

This repository contains code written based on the ideas in Williams
Calvin's 1996 book, The Cerebral Code [[1](#ref_1)].  (The author has
made available the full text of the book [[2](#ref_2)]).  In that book
the author describes brains as Darwin Machines: an organ that evolved
to perform Darwinian tuning up of thoughts in what we humans
experience as real time.

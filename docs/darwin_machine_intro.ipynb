        "Lately, the trends analysing the traits of likeness between the evolutionary process, immune reactions and brain activity was called as \"neurodarwinism\" (**G. Edelman**). It has been established that pre-existed diversity of the material to be selected is the main condition of successful adaptation of the living organism to unknown future. The review of the data obtained in the course of studying the dominant by V. S. Rusinov's school shows that namely the dominant mechanism does ensure the variety of neuronal and behavioural assortment from which new adaptive behavioural acts are formed. This statement allows to consider further theoretical and experimental study of the dominant phenomenon as one of the priority and promising trends of the modern neurobiology.\n"

        "> My starting point is evolution through natural selection (ENS). A population which can undergo ENS must comprise causally connected objects (called here Darwinian individuals), which must in turn be characterised by three properties. Firstly, they must vary with respect to traits such as weight, intelligence or biochemical pathways. Furthermore, these traits must influence the fitness output of the Darwinian individuals. This means that differences in traits influence the reproduction and survival of individuals. Finally, these traits must be heritable, at least to some extent, by offspring. Evolution by natural selection, thus, will take place in any population in which there are phenotypic variations, heritability, and differences in fitness (reproductive output) caused, at least in part, by these variations. Combining these three properties, we come to the conclusion that Darwinian individuals must be reproducers (Griesemer 2000; Godfrey-Smith 2009), because reproducers are the only units capable of transforming the resources they find around them in order to produce more reproducers and thus are causally responsible for parent-offspring similarity (fulfilling the heritability criterion mentioned above). Assuming we have, therefore, a diverse population of reproducers competing for limited resources, only some reproducers will obtain them and produce offspring; others will undergo decay, gradually transforming them back into resources: the thread which has linked them via parent-offspring lineage to the first reproducer is broken. Indeed, such a population will experience evolution by natural selection.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Interestingly, we find different kinds of reproducers in nature. Godfrey-Smith (2009) cited three. The first are scaffolded reproducers: those entirely dependent on external machinery. For instance, viruses belong to this category, because they need the biochemical machinery of cells to reproduce. The second category includes simple reproducers. Reproducers of this kind possess inner machinery, and thus need only external resources to initiate reproduction. One example is a bacterial cell. The third category constitutes collective reproducers, i.e. those built of simple reproducers. In essence, a collective reproducer is an entity that can reproduce itself, but which is also built of elements that can reproduce themselves. An example is multicellular individuals built of eukaryotic cells. The above classification is not artificial, but rather a consequence of the fact that evolution is a process not only of differential reproduction of Darwinian individuals, but as well one that leads to the origin of new kinds of Darwinian individuals, called transitions in individuality (Michod 2000; Godfrey-Smith 2009). These transitions occur when a group of units comes together to form a higher level of unit that can undergo the process of natural selection itself, as it becomes a new, collective reproducer, as in the case of transition from unicellular to multicellular individuals (Buss 1988; Maynard-Smith and Szathmary 1995) or from prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells containing mitochondria that were formerly free-living cells (Margulis 1981). Of course, this is not the whole story. Reproducers are much more diverse than the above classification suggests. This diversity was extensively elaborated by Godfrey-Smith (2009). For instance, collective reproducers such as animals and plants differ in their method of reproduction, since some species multiply sexually, some through fragmentation of the body and others via both routes. Such considerations are quite interesting and illuminating; however, for the purpose of this paper, the classification introduced above is sufficient."

So we take, in this case, one layer -- layer FC7 -- and we connect all the units in FC7 in an all to all fashion. So we add horizontal recurrent connections everywhere in layer FC7, and we build what's called an attractor network. These are networks that have attractor states that have been shown many years ago to be able to solve problems of pattern completion. This was introduced by a person called John Hopfield, and these are known in the literature as Hopfield networks. So basically what we're doing is we're taking a deep convolutional network-- in this case, AlexNet-- and we're inducing at the top an attractive network, a Hopfield network at the level of FC7."

        ">Evolutionary transitions in individuality are central to the emergence of biological complexity. Recent experiments provide glimpses of processes underpinning the transition from single cells to multicellular life and draw attention to the critical role of ecology. Here we emphasise this ecological dimension and argue that its current absence from theoretical frameworks hampers development of general explanatory solutions. Using mechanistic mathematical models, we show how a minimal ecological structure comprised of patchily distributed resources and between patch dispersal can scaffold Darwinian-like properties on collectives of cells. This scaffolding causes cells to participate directly in the process of evolution by natural selection as if they were members of multicellular collectives, with collectives participating in a death-birth process arising from the interplay between the timing of dispersal events and the rate of resource utilisation by cells. When this timescale is sufficiently long and new collectives are founded by single cells, collectives experience conditions that favour evolution of a reproductive division of labour. Together our simple model makes explicit key events in the major evolutionary transition to multicellularity. It also makes predictions concerning the life history of certain pathogens and serves as an ecological recipe for experimental realisation of evolutionary transitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Introduction**\n",
        ">Central to each of these transitions was the emergence of properties at the newly formed level that allowed individuals — at this level — to participate directly in the process of evolution by natural selection. This required newly formed collectives to be discrete and vary one to another, to reproduce\n",
        "and to leave offspring that resemble parental types. These essential and intertwined Darwinian properties of variation, differential reproduction and heredity are such fundamental features of living systems that it is easy to overlook the fact that **individuality is a derived state and in need of\n",
        "evolutionary explanation**.  \n",
        ">With focus on multicellular life, it is evident that reproduction, in even simple multicellular forms, is a complex process. It is therefore tempting to invoke selection as its cause. But this is problematic because the earliest collectives lacked capacity for collective-level reproduction and thus to invoke selection at the collective level as the cause of collective-level reproduction is to invoke the trait requiring explanation as the cause of its own evolution. Clearly such an explanation is unsatisfactory.  \n",
        ">...  \n",
        ">We do not wish to downplay the importance of co-option, but there is conceivable value in asking whether Darwinian properties might emerge in the absence of co-option. Such a take-nothing-for66 granted line of inquiry presents a challenge as it requires conceiving possibilities for the emergence of properties essential for collectives to participate in the process of evolution by natural selection from starting states that lack any manifestation of collective-level Darwinian properties. In essence it begs explanations for how Darwinian properties might emerge from non-Darwinian entities and therefore by non-Darwinian means. Solutions stand to inform not only how multicellular states arise from single cells, but how Darwinian properties might emerge during each of the major evolutionary transitions, including that from non-living matter.  \n",
        ">A solution that we advance draws heavily on ecology, the significance of which we suggest has been\n",
        "overlooked — even though the importance of population structure has been emphasised by literature\n",
        "on the levels of selection. It recognises that Darwinian properties can be “scaffolded” by the\n",

Discrete lineages established from the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens were propagated under conditions that required, for long-term persistence, repeated completion a two-phase\n",
        "life cycle involving soma and germ-like states. In the experiment, variation was discretised using glass microcosms, but the design is synonymous with an environment such as a pond in which reeds extend from the water. Each reed allows establishment of a single microbial mat (the soma-like phase), with the spacing of reeds ensuring variation at the level of mats. Mats that collapse, for example, through physical disturbance, are extinguished, allowing the possibility that an extant mat might, via production of a dispersing (germ-like) phase, increase its representation among the population of mats. Thus the possibility of a selective process unfolds at the level of mats. After ten lifecycle generations, the fitness of derived mats significantly improved, with the most successful lineage having even evolved a simple genetic switch that ensured reliable developmental change between soma and germ-line phases. Not only does this study demonstrate that scaffolding works, but it also showed that externally imposed Darwinian properties can begin the shift toward endogenisation. Or to quote Van Valen: “evolution is the control of development by ecology”.  \n",

The creative darwinian process will run without them, but they affect the stability of its outcome, or the rate of evolution, and will be important for my model of cognitive functions. Just like the catalysts and enzymes that speed chemical reactions without being consumed, they may make improbable outcomes into commonplace ones.\n",
        ">7. Stability may occur, as in getting stuck in a rut (a local peak or basin in the adaptational landscape). Variants occur but they backslide easily. Only particularly large variations can ever escape from a rut, but they are few, and even more likely to produce nonsense (phenotypes that fail to develop properly, and so die young).\n",
        ">8. Systematic recombination generates many more variants than do copying errors and the far-rarer cosmic-ray mutations. Recombination usually occurs once during meiosis (the grandparent chromosomes are shuffled as haploid sperm and ova are made) and again at fertilization (as the haploid parent genomes are combined into diploid once again, at fertilization). Sex, in the sense of gamete dimorphism (going to the extremes of expensive ova and cheap sperm), was invented several billion years ago and greatly accelerated species evolution over the rate promoted by errors, bacterial conjugation, and retroviruses.\n",
        ">9. Fluctuating environments (seasons, climate changes, diseases) change the name of the game, shaping up more complex patterns capable of doing well in several environments. For such jack-of-all-trades selection to occur, the environment must change much faster than efficiency adaptations can track it, or \"lean mean machine\" specialists will dominate the expensive generalists.\n",
        ">10. Parcellation, as when rising sea level converts the hilltops of one large island into an archipelago of small islands, typically speeds evolution. This is, in part, because more individuals then live on the margins of the habitat where selection pressure is greater. Also, there is no large central population to buffer change. When rising sea level converted part of the coastline of France into the island of Jersey, the red deer trapped there in the last interglaciation underwent a considerable dwarfing within only a few thousand years. [**JFT: this parcelation sounds a lot like ecological scaffolding's: \"nothing more than patchily distributed resources and a means of between patch dispersal\".**]\n",
        ">11. Local extinctions, as when an island population becomes too small to sustain itself, speed evolution because they create empty niches. When subsequent pioneers rediscover the unused resources, their descendants go through a series of generations where there is enough food -- even for the more extreme variations that arise, the ones that would ordinarily lose out in the competition with the more optimally endowed, such as the survivors of a resident population. When the environment again changes, some of those more extreme variants may be able to cope better with the third environment than the narrower range of variants that would reach reproductive age under the regime of a long-occupied niche.\n",
        ">Sexual selection also has the reputation of speeding evolution, and there are \"catalysts\" acting at several removes, as in Darwin's example of what introducing cats to an English village would do to enhance the bee-dependent flowers, via reducing the rodent populations that disrupt bee hives.\n",
        ">An example of how these catalysts work together is island biogeography, as in the differentiation of Darwin's finches unbuffered by large continental gene pools. Archipelagos allow for many parallel evolutionary experiments. Episodes that recombine the islands (as when sea level falls during an ice age) create winner-take-most tournaments. Most evolutionary change may occur in such isolation, in remote valleys or offshore islands, with major continental populations serving as slowly changing reservoirs that provide pioneers to the chancy periphery."
